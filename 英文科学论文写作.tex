\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

\lettrine{W}{ith}
the proliferation of the Internet technology, the explosively increasing amount of web pages on the World Wide Web has created the demand for the web searching engines with high-efficiency and high-effectiveness.
For the biggest search engine company Google, which held a global market share of 91.54\% until November 2023\footnote[1]{Search Engine Market Share Worldwide, Statcounter GlobalStats, 2023, https:
	//gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share}, it is of primary significance to develop a powerful search algorithm to provide users with the most relevant and useful results in the shortest time.

\end{figure}

Previous studies on web search algorithms have proven that TF-IDF algorithm and BM25 algorithm were efficient and effective in the early days of the Internet.

However, these algorithms have been unable to meet the growing demand of users.
The users' search queries are becoming diversified and the web pages are becoming complex.
According to the statistics, the amount of web pages, a 130-fold increase over 20 years, has surged to 130 trillion in 2016, which means it takes much longer time to search for the most relevant web pages.
To overcome the aformentioned chanllenge, Google has developed a state-of-the-art algorithm called PageRank, which is currently a fundamental algorithm in web search, redefining how we navigate web search.

\subsection{Introduction to the PageRank Algorithm}
PageRank is algorithm developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in the late 1990s to measure the importance of web pages.
It was originally created for the Google search engine and is named after one of the founder of Google Larry Page.
Google search engine uses the algorithm to analyze the relevance and importance of web pages and regard it as one of the factors to evaluate the effectiveness of web page optimization.

PageRank is an algorithm developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in the late 1990s to measure the importance of web pages.
Originally created for the Google search engine, it is named after one of the founder of Google Larry Page. Except for the searching use, the Google search engine also takes advantage of this algorithm to analyze the relevance and importance of web pages, considering it as one of the factors to evaluate the effectiveness of web page optimization.

\subsection{Outline of this Paper}

In this paper, we present the following insights and research:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The foundational principles of the PageRank algorithm.(Section 3, Subsection A)
	\item Analysis of its performance and the impact of the factors that can influence the search results and page rankings.(Section 4, Subsection A)
	\item Discussion on potential enhancements and exploration of the possibility of other factors that can improve PageRank performance.(Section 4, Subsection B)
\end{itemize}

In the next section, PageRank is briefly reviewed and analyzed.

\section{Related Work}

These section shows the brief concept of the PageRank algorithm. Theses concept motivate the design of our research.

\subsection{Synopsis of PageRank}

PageRank is a link ana1ysis algorithm and it assigns a numerical weighting to each element of hyperlinked set of documents. It is aimed to achieve the purpose of measuring the relative importance of a element of a collection. The algorithm can be applied to any collection containing mutual references between elements.We call the weight value of any element E as ``PageRank of E", which is represented symbolically as $\boldsymbol{PR(E)}$. Other factors such as ``Author Rank" can also affect the weight value of an element.

A PageRank results from a mathematical algorithm based on the webgraph, created by all World Wide Web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edge, taking into consideration anthority hubs such as CNN. The rank value indicates an importance of a particular page. A hyperlink to this web page is called ``a vote of support for this web page". The weight of each web is defined recursively, based on the weight of all pages linking to it. For example, a page linked to many pages will have a high PageRank.

Many academic papers on PageRank existed before Page and Brin's original paper. In actual situations, PageRank is easily exploited. Relevant research tends to focus on those PageRank results affected by errors. In order to solve the problem, Google launched a new attribute nofollow for web links. The attribute allows webmasters and blogger to create some links that do not count, which means that these links do not serve as the ``vote'' so that they can ignore the spam votes.

\subsection{Markov Chain}

Markov chain, also called discrete-time Markov chain, is named after the Russian mathematician Andrei Markov. The chain is a random process in state space that undergoes a transition from a state to another. The process requires ``memoryless'' properties. That means the probability distribution of the next state can only be determined by the current state. Simultaneously, the previous events in the time series have no connection with it. The specific type of ``memoryless'' is called Markov properties. Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real process.

At each step of the Markov chain, the system can maintain or change from one state to another according to the probability distribution. State changes are called transitions, and the probabilities associated with different state changes are called transition probabilities.

If the Markov chain runs for enough time, the distribution of its state will reach a stationary distribution and remain unchanged. Formally, if the Markov chain has $n$ states, the transition matrix is $P$
, and the stationary distribution vector is $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, then $\boldsymbol{\pi} = \boldsymbol{\pi} P$ is satisfied.

This means that the stationary distribution vector $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ is an eigenvector of the transfer matrix $P$ and corresponds to an eigenvalue of 1. Specifically, a stationary distribution has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [1.] $\boldsymbol{\pi_i}\geq0$, and $\sum\boldsymbol{\pi_i}=1$. That is, each element of a stationary distribution is non-negative and sums to 1, representing probability.
	\item [2.] $\boldsymbol{\pi} = \boldsymbol{\pi} P$. That is, the stationary distribution vector is the eigenvector of the transfer matrix, and the corresponding eigenvalue is 1. This shows that if the current state is stationary, then after one step of transition, the state distribution will still be stationary.
	\item [3.] Do not depend on initial state. No matter what the initial state is, after a long enough transfer, the Markov chain
	      The state distribution will reach a stationary distribution.
	\item [4.] Uniqueness. The stationary distribution of a Markov chain is unique.
\end{enumerate}

Stationary distribution represents the stable state of the Markov chain after long-term operation and will no longer be affected by the initial state.
It measures the frequency of each state in the entire chain, giving the Markov chain stable operation of each
the proportion of time spent in the state.

Assumeing that when we browse a page on the Internet, the process of selecting the next interface has no collection with that we browse before but only depends on the current page. This is a simple finite-state, discrete-time stochastic process that can be by described using a Markov chain.

\section{Discussion on potential enhancements}

\subsection{Flaws}

Although PageRank is a classic web page ranking algorithm, it also has some flaws.

The most obvious flaw is call ``uniform access assumption''. It assumes that users have an equal probability if accessing all web pages. Apparently, it is not always true. Users' hobbies and social areas may affect this possibility.

Except the ``uniform access assumption'', there are other flaws. For example, vulnerability to spam links is a serious problem. Spam links are those that exist on low-quality page or generated through SEO techniques. Their presence can influence the entire page ranking system. Another drawback of the PageRank algorithm is its difficulty in handling dynamic web pages. If the content of a web page changes frequently, the PageRank algorithm may not be able to reflect these changes in a timely manner. For example, some news websites publish a large number of news every day. If the PageRank algorithm only calculates it once when the website is updated, the importance of these news will not be reflected in the ranking in time. Simultaneously, PageRank also suffers from data sparsity and lack of topics. In some cases, the PageRank may overlook some important web pages due to a lack of links to web pages relevant to the search topic. In addition, because PageRank only considers link structure and ignores the content and topic of web pages, it may not adapt well to searches in some specific areas.
